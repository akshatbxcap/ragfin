Permissible value for RTO is 2 hrs.
Last back up was successfully completed at 4:00 AM, 27th April 2023

Recovery Team


Execution
Following are the steps taken to initiate, execute, and complete the BCP-DR drill:

Simulating the disaster scenario by shutting down the primary (DC) server.
Activating the DR VM as the active system.
Validating data replication and consistency between the primary and DR databases.
Verifying the functionality of the JAVA application hosted on the DR VM.
Testing the analytics VM's connection to the DR VM's database and its ability to perform tasks.
Monitoring the performance of the DR VM during the drill.
List issues encountered during the DR Activity, if any.
Determine and log the RPO and RTO
