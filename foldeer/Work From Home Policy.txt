Overview
We designed our work from home policy to make sure that working from home is beneficial to our employees and company
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for the work from home scenario. Employees must follow the procedure and the guidelines entailed in this document to apply for and work according to Xtracap’s set guidelines when working from home.

Scope
This policy applies to all Xtrcap employees, workforce members, and agents with a Xtracap owned or personal-workstation connected to the Xtracap network.

Policy
Employees work from home or telecommute when they complete their work at a place located outside of our company’s premises. They may work from home: Full-time On certain days dividing their schedule between being present at the office and working from a remote location. Work from home arrangements can be occasional, temporary or permanent. Reasons that could demand telecommuting include but are not limited to: 
Parenting 
Bad weather 
Emergencies 
Medical reasons
Work-life balance 
Overlong commute

Procedure: 
When employees plan to work from home, this procedure must be followed: Employees file a request through email at least one days in advance. Their managers must approve their request considering all elements we mentioned above. If the work from home arrangement spans for more than a week, managers and team members should meet to discuss details and set specific goals, schedules and deadlines. Employees who need to work from home for unforeseen reasons ( illness or temporary difficult commute) should file their request as soon as possible, so managers can consider and approve it.

Policy Compliance
Non-Compliance
An employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
