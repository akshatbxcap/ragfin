6.4 Email Security
1. Do not use email:
To send confidential/sensitive information, particularly over the Internet, unless it is first encrypted by an encryption system approved by Information Security;
To create, send, forward or store emails with messages or attachments that might be illegal or considered offensive by an ordinary member of the public i.e., sexually explicit, racist, defamatory, abusive, obscene, derogatory, discriminatory, threatening, harassing or otherwise offensive.
To commit the organization to a third party for example through purchase or sales contracts, job offers or price quotations, unless you are explicitly authorized by management to do so (principally staff within Procurement and HR). Do not interfere with or remove the standard corporate email disclaimer automatically appended to outbound emails;
For private or charity work unconnected with the organizationâs legitimate business;
In ways that could be interpreted as representing or being official public statements on behalf of the organization, unless you are a spokesperson explicitly authorized by management to make such statements;
To send a message from anyone elseâs account or in their name (including the use of false âfrom:â addresses). If authorized by the manager, a secretary may send email on the managerâs behalf but should sign the email in their own name per pro (âfor and on behalf ofâ) the manager;"

4. Emails on the corporate IT systems are automatically scanned for malicious software, spam and unencrypted proprietary or personal information. Unfortunately, the scanning process is not 100% effective (e.g., compressed and encrypted attachments may not be fully scanned), therefore undesirable/unsavory emails are sometimes delivered to users. Delete such emails or report them as security incidents to IT Help/Service Desk in the normal way.
5. Except when specifically authorized by management or where necessary for IT system administration purposes, employees must not intercept, divert, modify, delete, save or disclose emails.
6. Limited personal use of the corporate email systems is permitted at the discretion of local management provided always that it is incidental and occasional, and does not interfere with business. You should have no expectations of privacy: all emails traversing the corporate systems and networks are subject to automated scanning and may be quarantined and/or reviewed by authorized employees."
6,Acceptable Usage.txt,"7. Do not use Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or similar external/third-party email services (commonly known as âweb-mailâ) for business purposes.

12,Application Security.txt,"Overview
Web application vulnerabilities account for the largest portion of attack vectors outside of malware. It is crucial that any web application be assessed for vulnerabilities and any vulnerabilities be remediated prior to production deployment.
Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define web application security assessments within Xtracap. Web application assessments are performed to identify potential or realized weaknesses as a result of inadvertent mis-configuration, weak authentication, insufficient error handling, sensitive information leakage, etc.  Discovery and subsequent mitigation of these issues will limit the attack surface of Xtracap services available both internally and externally as well as satisfy compliance with any relevant policies in place.

Scope
This policy covers all web application security assessments requested by any individual, group or department for the purposes of maintaining the security posture, compliance, risk management, and change control of technologies in use at Xtracap

All application security assessments will be performed by delegated security personnel either employed or contracted by Xtracap. All findings are considered confidential and are to be distributed to persons on a âneed to knowâ basis.  Distribution of any findings outside of Xtracap is strictly prohibited unless approved by the Chief Information Officer.

Any relationships within multi-tiered applications found during the scoping phase will be included in the assessment unless explicitly limited.  Limitations and subsequent justification will be documented prior to the start of the assessment.
Policy
4.1 Web applications are subject to security assessments based on the following criteria:"
13,Application Security.txt,"New or Major Application Release â will be subject to a full assessment prior to approval of the change control documentation and/or release into the live environment.
Third Party or Acquired Application â will be subject to full assessment after which it will be bound to policy requirements.
Point Releases â will be subject to an appropriate assessment level based on the risk of the changes in the application functionality and/or architecture.
Patch Releases â will be subject to an appropriate assessment level based on the risk of the changes to the application functionality and/or architecture.
Emergency Releases â An emergency release will be allowed to forgo security assessments and carry the assumed risk until such time that a proper assessment can be carried out.  Emergency releases will be designated as such by IT Lead or an appropriate manager who has been delegated this authority.

4.2 All security issues that are discovered during assessments must be mitigated based upon the following risk levels. The Risk Levels are based on the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology. Remediation validation testing will be required to validate fix and/or mitigation strategies for any discovered issues of Medium risk level or greater."
14,Application Security.txt,"High â Any  issue must be fixed immediately or other mitigation strategies must be put in place to limit exposure before deployment.  Applications with  issues are subject to being taken off-line or denied release into the live environment.
Medium â Medium risk issues should be reviewed to determine what is required to mitigate and scheduled accordingly.  Applications with medium risk issues may be taken off-line or denied release into the live environment based on the number of issues and if multiple issues increase the risk to an unacceptable level.  Issues should be fixed in a patch/point release unless other mitigation strategies will limit exposure.
Low â Issue should be reviewed to determine what is required to correct the issue and scheduled accordingly.

4.3 The following security assessment levels shall be established by the IT Infra team or other designated organization that will be performing the assessments. 
Full â A full assessment is comprised of tests for all known web application vulnerabilities using both automated and manual tools based on the OWASP Testing Guide.  A full assessment will use manual penetration testing techniques to validate discovered vulnerabilities to determine the overall risk of any and all discovered.
Quick â A quick assessment will consist of a (typically) automated scan of an application for the OWASP Top Ten web application security risks at a minimum.
Targeted â A targeted assessment is performed to verify vulnerability remediation changes or new application functionality.

4.4 The current approved web application security assessment tools in use which will be used for testing are:

19,BCP.txt,"Introduction  
Business survival in the current competitive environment necessitates planning for every type of business disruption including - but by no means limited to - the categories of natural disasters; hardware and communications failures; internal or external sabotage or acts of terrorism; and the failures of supply chain and sales affiliate organizations. While some business disruptions, may give advance warning others, such as terrorism, flash floods, fire, etc., can strike without notice. The threats that we (and by extension our clients) face today are more numerous and complex than those we have faced in the past. In addition, this is not going to change - tomorrow's threat environment will be much worse than todays. These disruptions usually affect the normal operations of the business, with results ranging from insured losses of replaceable tangibles to uninsurable capital losses, customer dissatisfaction, and even possible desertion. 

The situation gets more complex with the growth of e-commerce and other factors, having driven system availability expectations toward 24 X 7. The average organizationâs requirement for recovery time from a major system outage now ranges between 2 and 24 hours.

Xtracap being a customer-oriented organization with the philosophy of growing together with customers is sensitive to the impact that any such break down would have on its customerâs business and commitments. This has led to the formulation of a holistic approach to Disaster Management and Business Process Continuity for Xtracap as the Continuity of Business Plan. The purpose of the plan is to equip Xtracap to be able to respond to any type of situation - including those that we have not identified as a threat. To put in place management controls to respond quickly and to a plan as situations unfold."
20,BCP.txt,"Objective
The objectives of a Business Continuity Plan are (but not limited to):

To minimize interruptions to normal operations. 
To limit the extent of disruption and damage. 
To establish alternative means of operation in advance. 
To provide immediate solution for smooth and rapid restoration of service. 

Scope
The scope of the disaster recovery plan for the Xtracap  office covers high impact risks. 

High impact risks:

Loss of access to office facilities due to 
political unrest/disturbances â medium probability, high impact

Loss of office facilities due to 
Fire â Low probability, high impact
Floods- Low probability, high impact
Landslips/Subsidence - medium probability, high impact

Loss of network connectivity - low probability, high impact

Scope excludes: Client-owned information resources exclusively governed by clientâs own Disaster recovery and Business Continuity procedure. Also, area level disasters are outside the scope of BCP, but best efforts will still be made.

Primary Location
Xtracap Fintech
5th Floor, The Circle - Huda City Centre, Sector 29, Gurugram, Haryana 122002

Alternative Operational Plan
As because of our setup and arrangement, we may operate virtually from any location as most of our key employees have been given Laptop and Internet Data cards. During emergencies they can take current backup from their laptop or connect to clientâs server to continue their tasks, where copy of original data is also available.
Maintenance of Procedure
Ensuring that the procedure reflects ongoing changes to resources is crucial. This task includes updating the Plan and revising this document to reflect the updates, testing the updated Plan and training personnel. This Plan undergoes a formal review, at least once in a year, to confirm the incorporation of all changes since the previous review and the task is done by CISO. Further testing of BCP is also done once a year by use of either of simulation testing, walk-through, and checklist-based testing, etc.

Strategy for Continuity of Business Plan (CoBP)
The Plan is predicated on the validity of the following assumptions: 

The situation that causes the disaster is localized to the facility of Operations and Systems in the current office premises of Xtracap Fintech at Gurugram.
It should be noted however, that the Plan would still be functional and effective even in an area-wide disaster. Even though the basic priorities for restoration of essential services to the surrounding affected areas will normally take precedence over the recovery of an individual organization. Xtracap's Continuity of Business Plan can still provide for a more expeditious restoration of our resources for supporting key functions.
The continuity of business plan is based on the availability of the hot sites or the back-up resources, as described in this document. The accessibility of these, or equivalent back-up resources, is a critical requirement."
22,BCP.txt,"Overview of the Continuity of Business Plan (CoBP)
Xtracap recognizes the low probability of severe damage to Data Processing, Telecommunication, or Support Services capabilities at both Xtracap and any of its preferred vendors. Nevertheless, a plan like the COBP is necessary to identify the potential impact of such an incident on the assets of Xtracap and its clients.

Procedure
The business continuity plan essentially requires infrastructure, system, people, and process management to be mobilized in case of any kind of contingency to re-locate the Offshore projects to alternate site to have the minimal impact on the business and to avoid reputation loss. The following sections describe the process of recovery of systems, people, and processes in times of disaster.

Disaster may be classified into 3 categories depending on the area affected due to it:
Local - affecting systems, infrastructure & people at a particular location or in a designated part of the organization.
Zonal - affecting the entire building due to factors such as fire, bomb blasts, etc;
Regional - affecting the building and surrounding areas due to factors like major terrorist attack, political turmoil, earthquakes, floods etc.

37,BCP.txt,"Emergency Incident Response Plan
This section of the document explains the importance of developing an incident response plan through a well-defined incident response framework. The framework comprises seven phases that ensure a consistent and systematic approach in handling such incidents. The details for each of the seven phases is summarized below:
Phase 1 â Preparation: In any incident response plan, it is essential to form an Incident Response Team (âIRTâ) prior to other tasks. The role of the team is to promptly handle an incident so that it will have minimal impact to the business operation. The team is formed of members from various functional roles in your organisation. The process of setting up the team is explained in section 4.1.
Phase 2 â Identification: The occurrence of an incident is unpredictable. An anomaly in the system behaviour may indicate an incident or configuration errors. Hence, identifying an incident amidst routine daily operations is not an easy task. In section 4.2, some guidelines are provided to facilitate the process of positively identifying an intrusion incident.
Phase 3 â Assessment: After the identification phase, an initial assessment should be performed to confirm the existence of the incident. The assessment should include determining the scope, the impact of the incident, and the extent of the damage caused by the incident.
Phase 4 â Containment: Containment of the incident is necessary to minimise and isolate the damage incurred by your Company. In section 4.4, some guidelines are provided to help determine the appropriate course of action for limiting the extent of the incident.
Phase 5 â Eradication: In order to successfully eliminate the incident, the IRT need to determine the cause of the incident that resulted in the compromise of the system."
38,BCP.txt,"Phase 6 â Recovery: The recovery phase restores operations of the compromised system to facilitate the resumption of normal business operations. Prior to the resumption process, a validation check should be performed to ensure that the system is secured against any repeated incidents. Furthermore, the system should be placed under surveillance to ensure that if the perpetrator returns, unauthorised attempts may be detected early.
Phase 7 â Follow-up: As a follow-up, you should perform a post-mortem analysis of the compromised system to understand the weaknesses that resulted in the incident and other potential vulnerable areas. In the event that the Company is considering legal action against the perpetrator, it is recommended that forensic specialists and/or law enforcement agencies should be engaged to ensure that digital evidence are accumulated and preserved in a manner that is consistent with the legislative requirements.

Incident Definition
A security incident can be any of the following:

violation of an explicit or implied security policy

attempts to gain unauthorized access

unwanted denial of resources

unauthorized use of electronic resources

Modification without the ownerâs knowledge, instruction, or consent.

As an illustration, one of the security requirements in the Xtracap  is to ensure that all vendor-supplied default system passwords should be changed. There are many websites that publish default passwords for many vendor products. One of the websites is http://www.astalavista.com. If an intruder compromises a router using its default password obtained from the above website, an incident has occurred. Using the compromised device, further exploits may be launched against other systems or network devices in the IT infrastructure.

Incident Classification"
39,BCP.txt,"Incident Severity Level
Once classification of the incident has occurred, the severity level of the incident can be determined. The severity level of the incident will dictate the course of actions that should be performed to resolve the incident. The following five severity levels may be assigned to the incident:


Incident Response

The objective of an incident response is to provide a systematic approach in developing an incident response plan. A well-defined incident response plan will enable you to handle any incident efficiently and effectively with minimal impact to the business operations. When developing these plans, efforts must be made to anticipate scenarios before they happen, and to make the following decisions in advance:

Where did the incident happen?

Which areas of the business processes are affected?

Who should be notified?

What are the procedures/actions to be taken?

How should the procedures/actions be performed?

Preparation
An Incident Response Team (IRT) is made up of senior management and experienced people â these are immediately made, which are comprises of the stakeholders discussed above or as needed from the organization. The role of the IRT is to promptly handle an incident so that containment, investigation and recovery can quickly occur. The IRT should be empowered by the top management to have decision-making authority for facilitating the incident response process. The needs and resources of the company also play a part in the selection of the team members. Below picture illustrates an overview of the team structure in IRT:"
40,BCP.txt,"IRT Leader 			: Inderjit Singh Bedi	
Supervisory Team Leader	: Nitin Verma
Supervisory Team Member	:Pulkit Dham
Note: More people may be added as needed.

The responsibility of the Supervisory Team includes:
Making decisions on, and reviewing steps taken to rectify matters
Communicating and translating technical information to senior management or board of directors
Supervising and reviewing test results based on the tests conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the incident response procedures
Cooperating with and supplying information to the support team so that their duties can be carried out
Coordinating resources, e.g. software and hardware acquisition, if required
Maintaining proper records of events and actions taken
Attending, establishing and conducting training for relevant personnel
Performing scenario planning and identifying corrective actions for each scenario; and
Supervising and reviewing the update, including lessons learnt, on the Incident Response Procedures.

The responsibility of the Site Team includes:
Surveying and securing the systems and environment
Containing the incident
Eradicating incident and performing recovery procedures
Compiling ârecovery kitâ, e.g. recovery procedures, contact list, boot disks, software, tools, hard disk, and so on
Attending and conducting training for relevant personnel and
Updating and maintaining the Incident Response Procedures.

The responsibility of the Support Team includes:
Providing logistic and technical support to other IRT teams when required
Updating public and relevant authorities via commercial press, web sites, telephone and others, and
Coordinating communications for the company with various external parties, if required.

A leader will be appointed in the IRT as the point of contact in the event of an incident. When an incident is reported by the helpdesk, the leader will be responsible for contacting the relevant sub-teams to handle the incident."
41,BCP.txt,"When reporting the incident, communication should be made via the telephone, etc. This is to prevent interception of emails by the perpetrator if the computer used for sending the email has been compromised or by a âsnifferâ program that has been planted on the network to capture information sent across the network. Should sensitive electronic media need to be passed to a third party (e.g. listings of account numbers that were leaked) this may be done via secure courier. However the media must be strongly encrypted.
Depending on situation, support from other technical teams in the Company (e.g. the network operations, anti-virus team or IT helpdesk) may be required to assist in the incident handling process.

Identification
The cost of incident response and recovery can be high. When a staff member notices a suspicious anomaly in data, a system, or the network, the IRT must perform investigation and verification, which is time and resource consuming. This activity is at risk if the number of false reports exceeds the number of real incidents that occurred, as it diverts resources away from real incidents. To facilitate the task of identification, the following is a list of typical symptoms of security incidents, which include any or all the following:"
42,BCP.txt,"A system alarm or similar indication from an intrusion detection tool
Suspicious entries in system or network accounting (e.g. a UNIX user obtains root access without going through the normal sequence)
Accounting discrepancies (e.g. an eighteen-minute gap in the accounting log with no entries)
Repetitive unsuccessful logon attempts within a short time interval
Unexplained new user accounts, new files or unfamiliar file names
Phishing messages
Unexplained modifications to file lengths and/or dates, especially in system executable files
Unexplained attempts to write to system files or changes in system files
Unexplained modification or deletion of data
Denial/disruption of service or inability of one or more users to login to an account
Ransomware attack
Poor system performance of dedicated servers
Operation of a program or sniffer device to capture network traffic
Unusual time of usage (e.g. users login during non-working hours)
An indicated last time of usage of a user account that does not correspond to the actual last time of usage for that user, and
Unusual usage patterns (e.g. programs are being compiled in the account of a Finance user with no programming background).

Although no single symptom conclusively shows that a security incident is taking place, observing one or more of these symptoms prompts the observer to investigate events more closely. System administrators who encounter one or more of these symptoms should work with the IRT to determine the cause of the incident. Using the above-mentioned categories of incidents as reference, the IRT should validate security incidents on a per case basis before proceeding with the other phases in the framework. All details in the Identification phase should be documented in the Incident Reporting Form."
43,BCP.txt,"Assessment
The next step to be taken by the IRT is to assess the scope, the impact and the magnitude of the incident. As a note of precaution, never power off or reboot a compromised system immediately as this may result in the loss of data, information or evidence required for forensic investigation later. The following are some of the factors to consider during the assessment:

How many computers are affected by this incident?
Is sensitive information involved?
What is the entry point of the incident (e.g. network, phone dial)?
What is the potential damage caused by the incident?
What is the estimated time to recover from the incident?
What resources are required to manage the situation?
How should the assessment be performed effectively?

Depending on the severity of the situation, top management may have to be informed. Notification guidelines should be developed by the IRT during the preparation of the incident response plan. For âExtremeâ and âHighâ risk incidents, the IRT should escalate them to Visa. The Incident Reporting Form can be used to document the information gathered from the assessment.

Containment
The objective of the containment phase is for the IRT to regain control of the situation by limiting the extent of the damage. The IRT may consider isolating the compromised system from the rest of the network systems. However, this may disrupt the business operation if the compromised system is critical or many systems were affected by the incident, as in the example of a virus outbreak. Hence, the IRT must evaluate with the management on a per case basis the risk of continuing operations versus regaining control of the compromised system. All attempts to contain the threat must consider every effort to minimize the impact to the business operations."
44,BCP.txt,"Furthermore, a backup should also be performed on the system to maintain the current state of the system to facilitate the post-mortem and forensic investigation later. The IRT may also consider changing the system passwords to prevent the possibility of Trojan programs being installed on the compromised system that allows the intruder from returning to the system via a backdoor.

Eradication
After the containment phase, further investigation should be performed to uncover the cause of the incident by analyzing system logs of various devices (e.g., firewall, router, host logs). It is important that the IRT uses a separate set of administrative tools for the investigation and not those in the compromised system. If the perpetrator has modified the system configuration, execution of any system tools may have dire consequences. For example, the intruder may have modified the DOS CMD.EXE application of the compromised system to delete all files in the system rather than to return a command shell.

A clean operating system should be reloaded into the compromised server after the investigation. Many off-the shelf operating systems are not developed with security in mind. Hence, to increase the security defence of the system, it must undergo a hardening process, which should include:

Applying all the latest patches
Disabling any unnecessary services
Installing anti-virus software, and
Applying the Companyâs security policy to the system.

Recovery
Prior to restoring the system from a clean backup, it is recommended that the IRT validate that the eradication procedures have been properly performed. After installing the backup, the system should be monitored in a test environment to determine if it is functioning normally before it can be restored into the business operation."
45,BCP.txt,"Documentation and Records
All details related to the incident response process should be documented and filed for easy reference. This provides valuable information to unravel the course of events and can serve as evidence if prosecution of intruders is necessary. It is recommended that the following items be maintained:

All system events (audit records)
All actions taken (including the time that an action is performed), and
All external conversations (including person with whom the discussion was held, the date and time and the content of the conversation).

Furthermore, an incident report documenting the following should be written by the IRT at the end of the exercise:
A description of the exact sequence of events
The method of discovery
Preventive measure put in place, and
Assessment to determine if the recovery step taken is sufficient and what other recommendations need to be considered
The objective of the report is to identify potential areas of improvement in the incident handling and reporting procedures. Hence, the review of the report by management should be documented, together with the lessons learnt, to improve on the identified areas and used as reference for future incidents."

57,Capacity Management Process.txt,"INTRODUCTION
2.1 PROCESS OVERVIEW
The process of capacity planning is shown below.

This process will be used as the basis for capacity management within Xtracap and is described in more detail in the following sections."
58,Capacity Management Process.txt,"2.2 System Recovery Procedure
2.2.1 Forecast Future Capacity Requirements
The purpose of this step is to capture and understand the changing business requirement for capacity. This may take a number of forms, such as:
increasing or decreasing use of existing applications by current users
the addition or removal of users
a change in the way the system is being used e.g. the introduction of a new batch job that must be run during the working day
a change in the days and/or times the services are used e.g. beginning Saturday working or overtime
Such changes may have an effect on a number of areas of infrastructure such as server processor and disk capacity or network bandwidth as well as upon other resources such as people and facilities engaged in delivering the service.
In order to gain as much advance knowledge of such changes as possible, business capacity requirements will be a key area addressed at each service review meeting and will be a standard agenda item. These meetings will be minuted and items affecting capacity management will be fed into the overall capacity plan for Xtracap Fintech India Pvt Ltd.
2.2.2 Plan to Meet Requirements
For each identified service provided by Xtracap Fintech India Pvt, an estimate of future capacity adjustments will be made. 
A capacity plan will be produced on an annual basis which will bring together the future demands on service components from business changes and the current utilisation of resources and identify any areas in which the provision of capacity needs to be adjusted. This may involve the justification of additional hardware such as server upgrades, the recruitment of additional support staff or the installation of higher bandwidth links between sites, amongst other proposals."
59,Capacity Management Process.txt,"Key to this task will be the understanding of which service components underpin each service and the dependencies between them. For shared resources such as file and print servers and domain controllers for example, the net impact of changes across all business areas must be considered.
Although initially produced on an annual basis, the capacity plan will be subject to amendments as and when significant changes are made to business requirements or to the infrastructure. These amendments will be made under the control of the change management process.

2.2.3 Monitor, Analyse and Report on Resource Usage
In order to understand the current use of our resources, where possible software tools will be used to record the utilisation of key components. As a minimum, these will be:
Server processor capacity
Server disk capacity
Network utilisation
Where feasible, this data will be collected continuously and stored for historical reporting purposes. A threshold will be set for key resources (such as disk capacity) so that an alert is generated if that threshold is exceeded, allowing immediate action to be taken.
The tools that will be used are:
Shell Scripts
Jenkins"
60,Capacity Management Process.txt,"2.2.4 Tune to Make Best Use of Resources
In addition to monitoring the actual usage of key resources, regular attention will also be paid to the correct setup and tuning of servers and network devices so that best performance can be obtained from the available resources. 
 This will cover issues such as:
Memory allocation
Swap space sizes
Job priorities
Identification of resource bottlenecks (e.g. insufficient disk arms)
An annual exercise will be carried out on all business-critical servers. All changes identified will be implemented under strict change management control.
2.3 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Service Manager
Consults with interested parties regarding potential capacity requirements in the next budget year
Prepares a draft capacity plan for review
Liaises with resource managers 
Proposes additional expenditure as part of budget cycle

Business Customer

Keeps the [Service Manager] informed of any amendments

Top Management
Approves the capacity plan
Considers budget implications of meeting requirements

Resource Manager
Monitors the usage levels of key resources

How will the policy be monitored?

As with all other Xtracap policies, under your contract of employment you agree to comply with the casual dress policy. Should your attire be regarded as inappropriate by your manager, he/she will let you know and reserves the right to require you to take unpaid leave to go home and change.

115,Password Protection.txt,"Overview
Passwords are an important aspect of computer security.  A poorly chosen password may result in unauthorized access and/or exploitation of our resources.  All staff, including contractors and vendors with access to Xtracapâs systems, are responsible for taking the appropriate steps, as outlined below, to select and secure their passwords. 

Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for creation of strong passwords and the protection of those passwords.

Scope
The scope of this policy includes all personnel who have or are responsible for an account (or any form of access that supports or requires a password) on any system that resides at any Xtracap facility, has access to the organizationâ network, or stores any non-public information.

Policy
Password Creation
All user-level and system-level passwords must conform to the Password Construction Guidelines.
Users must use a separate, unique password for each of their work related accounts.  Users may not use any work related passwords for their own, personal accounts.
User accounts that have system-level privileges granted through group memberships or programs such as sudo must have a unique password from all other accounts held by that user to access system-level privileges.  In addition, it is highly  that some form of multi-factor authentication is used for any privileged accounts

Password Change
Passwords should be changed at least once in every 42 days.
Password cracking or guessing may be performed on yearly or random basis. If a password is guessed or cracked during one of these scans, the user will be required to change it to be in compliance with the Password Construction Guidelines."
116,Password Protection.txt,"Password Protection
Passwords must not be shared with anyone, including supervisors and coworkers. All passwords are to be treated as sensitive, confidential information. Please refer to the technical reference for additional details. 
Passwords must not be inserted into email messages, Alliance cases or other forms of electronic communication, nor revealed over the phone to anyone. 
Passwords may be stored only in âpassword managersâ authorized by the organization.
Do not use the ""Remember Password"" feature of applications (for example, web browsers).
Any user suspecting that his/her password may have been compromised must report the incident and change all passwords.
Application Development
Application developers must ensure that their programs contain the following security precautions:
Applications must support authentication of individual users, not groups.
Applications must not store passwords in clear text or in any easily reversible form.
Applications must not transmit passwords in clear text over the network.
Applications must provide for some sort of role management, such that one user can take over the functions of another without having to know the other's password.

Multi-Factor Authentication
Multi-factor authentication is highly encouraged and should be used whenever possible, not only for work related accounts but personal accounts also."
117,Password Protection.txt,"Policy Compliance
Compliance Measurement
The IT Infra team will verify compliance to this policy through various methods, including but not limited to, periodic walk, video monitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and feedback to the policy owner. 
Exceptions
Any exception to the policy must be approved by the IT Infra head in advance. 
Non-Compliance
An employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
Related Standards, Policies and Processes
Password Construction Guidelines
Strong passwords are long, the more characters you have the stronger the password. We recommend a minimum of 14 characters in your password.  In addition, we highly encourage the use of passphrases, passwords made up of multiple words.  Examples include âItâs time for vacationâ or âblock-curious-sunny-leavesâ.  Passphrases are both easy to remember and type, yet meet the strength requirements.  Poor, or weak, passwords have the following characteristics: 

Contain eight characters or less.
Contain personal information such as birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, or names of family members, pets, friends, and fantasy characters.
Contain number patterns such as aaabbb, qwerty, zyxwvuts, or 123321.
Are some version of âWelcome123â âPassword123â âChangeme123â

In addition, every work account should have a different, unique password. To enable users to maintain multiple passwords, we highly encourage the use of âpassword managerâ software that is authorized and provided by the organization.  Whenever possible, also enable the use of multi-factor authentication. We also recommend that each month, the system password to your machine be changed for better security."
118,Physical Media Handling.txt,"Introduction  
Physical Media Handling is the critical aspect for any organizationâs communication method. It is of utmost importance that the policy is defined at  level to establish the need to secure information and information processing facilities. Access any kind of physical media should be controlled on the basis of business and security requirements.

Objective
The purpose of this Policy is to prevent unauthorized access to any physical media by any unauthorized people. This Policy is designed to protect physical media devices from unauthorized change, or destruction, whether intentional or accidental.

Scope
The scope of this Policy includes all XTRACAP employees. Each employee is responsible for carrying out his or her responsibilities under this Policy.


Policy"
119,Physical Media Handling.txt,"4.1 Management of Removable Media
 this presents two clear risks, loss of information and corruption of information or introduction of unknown software when the device is reintroduced onto the organisations network.
If no longer required, information should be deleted/destroyed and made unrecoverable. If  authorisation should be required and records of this kept. Cryptography should be considered in order to protect from loss of data. If the media is being removed for backup purposes, it should be stored separately (think co-location) to remove the risk of correlated threats, but security should be considered for  storage, and multiple copies could be considered on discrete devices to protect against degradation of the data. Removable drives should only be permitted as a conscious choice to accept rather than the other way around. IT departments need to be aware that enabling the USB sockets on the CEOs computer for ease of use is often the most straightforward way for a 3rd party to gain access (physically or logically) to the organisations network.
Documented procedures are required to cover the handling of removable media.

4.2 Disposal of Media
This should be done securely, and disposal records should be kept. If devices containing sensitive data are damaged it should be a consideration to physically destroy them rather than sending them to a third party for repair.

4.3 Physical Media Transfer
If subcontracted, a list of approved carriers / couriers should be  and procedures put in place for the identification of those couriers. Logs of identification of information, time of transfer and receipt should be maintained â this should form part of the procedures."
120,Physical Media Handling.txt,"Enforcement
Violations of this Policy include, but are not limited to: accessing information which the individual has no legitimate access to; enabling unauthorized individuals to access the media; disclosing media in a way which violates applicable policy, Policy or other relevant regulations or laws; or inappropriately modifying or destroying information. Violations may result in access revocation, corrective action up to and including dismissal, and/or civil or criminal prosecution under applicable law."

Xtracap grants access to these resources according to an individualâs role and must manage them responsibly to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all information assets. This policy specifies the conditions that wireless infrastructure devices must satisfy in order to connect to the Xtracap network. Only those wireless infrastructure devices that meet the standards specified in this policy or are granted an exception by CISO are approved for connection to the Xtracap network. 
Scope 
This policy addresses the requirements of Wireless deployments, Wireless usage, and Wireless airspace usage. All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and others who use the Xtracap network, including all personnel affiliated with third parties that maintain a wireless infrastructure device on behalf of Xtracap, must adhere to this policy.

Policy 
Wireless Deployments 
Standards supported: 
IEEE 802.11ac and 802.11n are the preferred wireless networking standards. 802.11g, 802.11b, and 802.11a will be available, where necessary. 
IEEE 802.1X is the authentication standard. Additional security procedures may be applied as needed. 
WPA2 with AES encryption will be the only secure standard used."
144,Wireless Network Policy.txt,"Service Set Identifier (SSID): There shall be three SSIDs broadcast by the wireless deployment. Only devices authenticated account credentials may access this SSID. 
Wireless Service Considerations: 
Wireless networking has bandwidth limitations compared to the wired network. The wireless network should be viewed as augmenting the wired network, to provide more flexible network use. Applications that require large amounts of bandwidth, or are sensitive to changes in signal quality and strength may not be appropriate for wireless access. 
Wireless technology is and will for the foreseeable future be a shared bandwidth technology. Some protocols and services will not effectively work in, or may be inappropriate for, a wireless environment.
 DHCP is the standard addressing method for the IC wireless networks, and is expected to meet the majority of customer requirements. 
Wireless is a dynamic service. Due to the dynamic nature of wireless, IP space serving the campus will change over time due to capacity re-engineering. 
Restrictions
Xtracap policy requires that all deployments of wireless infrastructure be installed and maintained by DIIS. Installing departmental or do-it-yourself wireless access points is prohibited to avoid possible interference with the IC wireless network, unnecessary impact to the wired network and to minimize undue security risks to the company. Additionally, in areas where centrally-managed wireless networking is available any pre-existing locally managed access points must be removed. 
Use of the wireless network is subject to the established policies for use of network services. 
Only devices authenticated via Xtracap account credentials may access network resources on its network that are not Internet facing.
